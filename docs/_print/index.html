    <div class="lead">Why EPCIS is necessary and how it can help organizations of all sizes and types.</div>
	<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The supply chain system can consist of a single organisation or multiple numbers of them, that are involved in providing clients or consumers with services or products. All physical and digital products progress through some form of supply chain activities before reaching the possession of customers. The accessibility and visibility of the product data throughout its life cycle in the supply chain is the primary concern for the organization as it needs to track the products in real-time and if required convey the relevant information to customers or other organizations. If organizations or entities involved in the supply chain system use their own schema or model to keep track of the items then it is very difficult to track the products end-to-end which make it hard for an organization to communicate with other organizations and share the data. To address this issue, there was a need for a standard that could be implemented within the supply chain system so as to enable tracking, tracing, and monitoring of goods at every step. Hence, GS1 introduced the global standard known as EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services).</p>
<p>Using the EPCIS standard organizations can generate and exchange visibility data within the organization or across different organizations. Even if a single entity is in charge of the development and delivery of the entire product, it is essential to keep track of all activities and processes so that the company can monitor all of its resources and operations in order to provide complete transparency and uplift user or client trust. EPCIS has been designed such that businesses of any size, shape and type can implement and take advantage of it. It offers total adaptability to meet different business and regulatory requirements.</p>
<h2 id="gs1-global-standard-one">GS1 (Global Standard One)</h2>
<p>The GS1 is a non-profit organization that develops and maintains standards for the identification, capture, and sharing of information. GS1 was established in April 1974 and is based in Brussels, Belgium. GS1 standards are being used by over 2 million businesses throughout the world. In 1974, GS1 standardized the EAN/UPC (European Article Number/Universal Product Code) barcode, which is still used and printed on a wide range of items today. GS1 operates in various industries like retail, healthcare, logistics, food service, technical industries, etc. GS1 has developed a standard for creating and sharing visibility data within and across multiple organizations known as EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services). Using the standards designed by GS1 various trading partners such as customers, suppliers, distributors, logistic service providers, retailers, etc. can use a common language for communication in their supply chain. The main goal of GS1 standards is to enhance the physical and digital supply chain performance, safety, security, and accessibility. GS1 has around 115 member organizations in various countries across the globe.</p>

    <div class="lead">Discover the specifics of EPCIS, how it works, and what OpenEPCIS is.</div>
	<h2 id="introduction--history">Introduction &amp; history</h2>
<p>EPCIS is an open ISO/IEC/GS1 standard that allows visibility data information to be captured and shared within an organization or between multiple organizations in the form of an event. The EPCIS standard is beneficial to organizations that move products between stages within the same organization as well as between organizations. The EPCIS event data can be used for all physical objects such as assets, products, logical units, reusable transport items, etc., or can also be used for digital objects such as music downloads, electronic books, electronic coupons, subscriptions, etc. The EPCIS standard was designed to improve cooperation between trading partners by exchanging comprehensive information on physical and digital items. The initial version of EPCIS 1.0 was released at the beginning of 2007. Later, EPCIS 1.1 and 1.2 were released in 2014 and 2016 respectively with various enhancements. The latest version, EPCIS 2.0, is published in June 2022 with a lot of significant enhancements.</p>
<p>The main objective of the EPCIS data is to provide visibility information within a specific business process. The following figure 1 describes how EPCIS data may be generated within a simple business process.</p>
<p><img src="./Fig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Generation of EPCIS events in a simple business process."></p>
<p id="refImage" align="center">Figure 1: Generation of EPCIS events in a simple business process.</p>
<p>Above figure depicts a simplified business process in which a manufacturer produces an item, which is then packed and shipped to the Retailer DC (Distribution Center). The item is received by Retailer DC, who then sends it to the appropriate Retail Store. The item is received by the retail store and moved to a sales area where a consumer can purchase it. The simplified flow of goods can consist of the following critical tracking events: packing, shipping, receiving the items, etc. At every step within these business processes, an EPCIS event is created. This EPCIS event provides information on what exactly was occurring to the items at that particular step. The entirety of all these EPCIS events provides a complete picture of the whole business process.</p>
<p>EPCIS events consist of context information comprising the five different dimensions What, When, Where, Why, and How. Each of these dimensions consists of multiple fields that make up the event information. Each dimension is independent of one another and not mandatory to include all dimensions/fields of dimensions in the EPCIS event. For example, the following pieces of information are produced for four dimensions when a product is shipped from the manufacturer to retail DC in the V2 business process mentioned above:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What</strong>: It contains what items or containers were sent to DC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When</strong>: It contains the date-time information when the items were shipped, along with the respective time zone offset information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Where</strong>: It contains information about the location from where the shipment was sent. Also, where the items are expected to be after the event has occurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why</strong>: It contains the business context of the information. For example, the business step in this particular event is shipping.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="areas-of-application-for-epcis">Areas of application for EPCIS</h2>
<p>EPCIS can stitch together individual events that have occurred over time in a particular supply chain within an organization or across multiple organizations. Hence, EPCIS provides many applications, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tracking</strong>: An organization can find exactly where the objects are present within the supply chain using the most recent EPCIS event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tracing</strong>: An organization can track the objects to their origin using all EPCIS events associated with the particular object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analysing</strong>: All the EPCIS events collected over a particular time can be interpreted in a specific business context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation</strong>: EPCIS events can trigger various other business processes in real-time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verification</strong>: Comparison of the real-time status of the object using the current EPCIS event and the anticipated state of the object.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="benefits-of-epcis">Benefits of EPCIS</h2>
<p>EPCIS can be used in various industries such as automotive, healthcare, food services, transport, retail, etc. It provides many benefits to organizations and customers, depending on the type of industry sector. Following are some most common beneficial aspects of the EPCIS standard in various industry sectors:</p>
<p>• Identify the origin of the object to support anti-counterfeit measures.</p>
<p>• Identify a chain of custody for an object along with date and time information.</p>
<p>• Validation of digital coupons in real-time.</p>
<p>• Recognise the freshness of the product.</p>
<p>• Provide notification on various attributes such as location, timing, status, quantity, or quality of the product in real-time.</p>
<p>• Ensure that items reach the consumers at the right location and time.</p>
<p>• Increase consumer protection.</p>
<h2 id="openepcis">OpenEPCIS</h2>

    <div class="lead">OpenEPCIS solution to transform EPCIS document from XML to JSON/JSON-LD and vice versa.</div>
	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The previous versions of the EPCIS standard i.e until EPCIS 1.2, supported event generation only in XML format. However, from EPCIS 2.0 events can be generated and transmitted in either XML or JSON/JSON-LD format. As the EPCIS standard has been adopted by various industry sectors such as automotive, food, healthcare, retail, and many more, where objects need to be tracked within or across multiple organizations, there is a need to convert the large EPCIS event document from either XML -&gt; JSON/JSON-LD or JSON/JSON-LD -&gt; XML format. This conversion can be useful for organizations to exchange data easily or maintain a single standard format throughout the application or for various other convenience purposes. Although there are many open-source ready-to-use tools available online and offline that offer these format conversions, they may not be able to convert the EPCIS events accurately or support large data. Also, during the conversion, some EPCIS attributes such as user extensions, sensor elements, etc need to be handled carefully and according to standards. Therefore, until now, there is no converter that effectively and efficiently converts the large EPCIS event document from XML to JSON/JSON-LD format and vice versa.
<br>
 </p>
<p>OpenEPCIS wants to support the EPCIS community by providing means to convert the EPCIS documents from one format to another with ease. The developed utility aimed to convert the bulk EPCIS events effectively and efficiently with little to no load on the memory by using advanced techniques, and technologies. The application also provides a single solution for converting EPCIS events irrespective of the industry, use case, or supply chain system. It reduces the time and effort for the various organizations as each of them does not have to develop the conversion tool. Also, maintain and incorporate modifications according to the different release versions of EPCIS. The converted EPCIS events conform to the latest version of the EPCIS, i.e. EPCIS 2.0.</p>

    <div class="lead">OpenEPCIS solution to transform EPCIS XML document from 1.2v to 2.0v and vice versa.</div>
	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The newest EPCIS version i.e. EPCIS 2.0, offers several improvements over earlier versions, including the inclusion of sensor data (How dimension), a new event type (AssociationEvent), a new property (PersistentDisposition), etc. which were not supported in earlier versions as standard EPCIS attributes. Additionally, EPCIS 1.2 used &lt;extension&gt; wrappers to include some of the common EPCIS attribute information; however, in EPCIS 2.0, these &lt;extension&gt; wrappers will be removed to make the event more simpler and straightforward. The implementers may view this as a major change. Therefore, a tool was required to make it simple for implementers to switch from EPCIS 1.2 to EPCIS 2.0 XML documents and vice versa. Also, support the EPCIS standard with backward and forward compatibility. The OpenEPCIS team identified the issue and created a tool that makes it simple to convert XML EPCIS documents from version 1.2 to 2.0 and vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Web application</strong>:
The tool is available as a web application that users can access directly to acquire the converted EPCIS XML document by providing either an 1.2 version or 2.0 version document as input. The web application is available <a href="https://tools.openepcis.io/openepcis-ui/">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>API endpoint</strong>:
With EPCIS document serving as request, users/developers can use the API to send request to OpenEPCIS&rsquo;s document version converter API and receive back the converted document as a response. These API&rsquo;s can also be used directly online or from within another application code.  Users can access the REST endpoint using Swagger-UI from <a href="https://tools.openepcis.io/q/swagger-ui/#/Document%20Version%20Converter%20Resource">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application code</strong>:
The utility has been developed using Java with Apache Xalan. The code is available at the OpenEPCIS GitHub account and can be accessed directly or as dependencies for other projects. The complete code can be found <a href="https://github.com/openepcis">here</a>.</p>

    <div class="lead">OpenEPCIS solution to generate event Hash-Ids for EPCIS XML/JSON document.</div>
	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>EPCIS standard consists of events that are triggered when objects involved progress through different steps in the supply chain. These events are sent to other organizations, stored in organization-specific repositories, or used for other purposes. There are times when the same event is triggered multiple times due to faulty hardware, poor implementations, or human mistake. Organizations typically do not want to send or store duplicate events. Consequently, a system that would allow each event to be identified individually was required. OpenEPCIS has developed the Event Hash Generator tool as a solution to this problem. Using the data contained in each event, this tool will create Hash-IDs for each EPCIS event.</p>
<p>The tool follows a predetermined order for properties, and all event data is always canonicalized. Therefore, even if the attributes are in a different order or the information is in URN/WebURI format, it is always guaranteed that the events will have the same Hash-Ids and be considered duplicate events. Storing unique data in the repository and avoiding confusion caused by several copies of the same event, would substantially help organizations. Currently, the tool supports the generation following Hash Ids: sha-256, sha-224, sha-384, sha-512, sha3-224, sha3-256, and sha3-512.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Web application</strong>:
Users can quickly access the tool on their browser and generate Hash-Ids for EPCIS events or documents in XML/JSON format. Additionally, users have the option to view the Pre-Hash string and select multiple hash algorithm types in accordance with their needs. You can access the web application from <a href="https://tools.openepcis.io/openepcis-ui/EventHash">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>API endpoint</strong>:
With their XML/JSON documents serving as request, users/developers can use the API to send requests to OpenEPCIS&rsquo;s Hash Generator API and receive back the converted document as a response. These API&rsquo;s can also be used directly online or from within another application code. Users can access the REST endpoint using Swagger-UI from <a href="https://tools.openepcis.io/q/swagger-ui/#/Hash%20Id%20Generator%20Resource">here</a>.</p>

    <div class="lead">OpenEPCIS solution to transform EPCIS identifiers from URN to DL WebURI and vice versa.</div>
	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Every digital or physical object such as documents, locations, products, assets, etc. is identified by universal identifiers. Starting from EPCIS 2.0, these universal Identifiers can be either represented using the EPC URI (Pure Identity URI) or Digital Link WebURI (until EPCIS 1.2 these identifiers were represented using only URN format). Applications that are using the EPCIS standard must use one of the syntaxes to identify the objects. Pure Identity URI is represented using the URN (Uniform Resource Name) format. An example of an SSCC (Serial Shipping Container Code) represented using the URN format is as follows:<br>
urn:epc:id:sscc: 234567.18901234567</p>
<p>Digital Link URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a newly introduced format with EPCIS 2.0 in which identifiers can be represented using the Web URI format. The above SSCC identifier example can be represented in Digital Link URI format as follows:<br>
<a href="https://id.gs1.org/00/123456789012345675">https://id.gs1.org/00/123456789012345675</a></p>
<p>In certain scenarios organization likes to make use of both formats for better visibility and accessibility so they need the option to translate the from URN to DL URI and vice versa. Hence, this OpenEPCIS utility has been developed which can convert the standard application identifiers from URN to Digital Link URI format and vice versa. It can be used independently or in conjunction with the other OpenEPCIS standard. It supports the following identifier types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supported instance-level identifiers:
<ul>
<li>SSCC : Serial Shipping Container Code</li>
<li>GTIN with serial (SGTIN) : Serialised Global Trade Item Number</li>
<li>UPUI : Unit Pack Identifier</li>
<li>GDTI with serial : Global Document Type Identifier</li>
<li>SGCN with serial : Serialised Global Coupon Number</li>
<li>GINC : Global Identification Number for Consignment</li>
<li>GSIN : Global Shipment Identification Number</li>
<li>GRAI with serial : Global Returnable Asset Identifier</li>
<li>GIAI : Global Individual Asset Identifier</li>
<li>ITIP : Individual Trade Item Piece</li>
<li>CPI with serial :  Component/Part Identifier</li>
<li>GSRN : Global Service Relation Number - Recipient</li>
<li>GSRNP : Global Service Relation Number – Provider</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supported class-level identifiers:
<ul>
<li>GTIN : Global Trade Item Number</li>
<li>GTIN + Lot (LGTIN) : GTIN + Batch/Lot</li>
<li>GDTI without serial</li>
<li>SGCN without serial</li>
<li>GRAI without serial</li>
<li>CPI without serial</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supported location/party identifiers:
<ul>
<li>GLN with extension : Global Location Number without extension</li>
<li>GLN without extension : Global Location Number with extension</li>
<li>Party GLN : Party Global Location Number</li>
</ul>
</li>

    <div class="lead">OpenEPCIS solution for generating EPCIS test data events for all user cases/supply chain.</div>
	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The problem for various solution providers and user companies adopting EPCIS for their projects is to generate test data for testing purposes (load tests, populating test databases, etc.). OpenEPCIS Test Data Generator was developed to assist the EPCIS community by making it simple to generate test data (e.g. hundreds or thousands of events). Regardless of the industry, use case, or supply chain system, the developed application provides a single solution for creating test events. It saves time and effort for the various organizations because they don&rsquo;t have to build, maintain, or incorporate new capabilities of EPCIS into their test data production technologies. Based on the information provided by users and their organizational needs, the application can create bulk EPCIS events. These EPCIS events are compliant with EPCIS 2.0, the most recent version of the EPCIS, and events are generated in JSON/JSON-LD format. It also includes the option to generate events and identifiers in both URN and WebURI format.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Web application</strong>:
The web application is beneficial to users who are new to the EPCIS world as it visually provides all the components of the EPCIS which are segregated based on different dimensions. It is very easy to provide values for necessary fields based on the requirement or supply chain and generate the EPCIS events accordingly. The web application can be fround from <a href="https://test-data-generator.openepcis.io/">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>API endpoint</strong>:
Users can make use of API endpoint to generate test data events. The required template with all information can be sent to Restful API end point which will be analysed and events are generated.
