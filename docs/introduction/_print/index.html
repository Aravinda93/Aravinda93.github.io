      <h2 id="background">Background:</h2>
<p>The supply chain system is made up of several organizations, events, people, and tools that are participating in delivering services or goods to customers. All physical and digital products progress through some form of supply chain activities before reaching the possession of customers. The accessibility and visibility of the product data throughout its life cycle in the supply chain is the primary concern for the organization as it needs to track the products in real-time and if required convey the relevant information to customers or other organizations. If each organization or entity involved in the supply chain system uses its own schema or model to keep track of the items then it is very difficult to track the products end-to-end and makes it hard for an organization to communicate with other organizations and share the data. To address this issue, there was a need for a standard that could be implemented by all businesses within their supply chain system so as to enable tracking, tracing, and monitoring of goods at every step of the supply chain. Hence, GS1 introduced the global standard known as EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services).</p>
<h2 id="gs1-global-standard-one">GS1 (Global Standard One):</h2>
<p>The GS1 is a non-profit organization that develops and maintains standards for the identification, capture, and sharing of information. GS1 was established in April 1974 and is based in Brussels, Belgium. GS1 standards are being used by over 2 million businesses throughout the world. In 1974, GS1 standardized the EAN/UPC (European Article Number/Universal Product Code) barcode, which is still used and printed on a wide range of items today. GS1 operates in various industries like retail, healthcare, logistics, food service, technical industries, etc. GS1 has developed a standard for creating and sharing visibility data within and across multiple organizations known as EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services). Using the standards designed by GS1 various trading partners such as customers, suppliers, distributors, logistic service providers, retailers, etc. can use a common language for communication in their supply chain. The main goal of GS1 standards is to enhance the physical and digital supply chain performance, safety, security, and accessibility. GS1 has around 115 member organizations in various countries across the globe.</p>

    <div class="lead">This page provides the introduction to the EPCIS standard.</div>
	<h2 id="epcis">EPCIS:</h2>
<p>EPCIS is an open ISO/IEC/GS1 standard that allows visibility data information to be captured and shared within an organization or between multiple organizations in the form of an event. The EPCIS event data can be used for all physical objects such as assets, products, logical units, reusable transport items, etc., or can also be used for digital objects such as music downloads, electronic books, electronic coupons, subscriptions, etc. The EPCIS standard was designed to improve cooperation between trading partners by exchanging comprehensive information on physical and digital items. The initial version of EPCIS 1.0 was released at the beginning of 2007. Later, EPCIS 1.1 and 1.2 were released in 2014 and 2016 respectively with various enhancements. The latest version, EPCIS 2.0, is published in June 2022 with a lot of significant enhancements.</p>
<p>The main objective of the EPCIS data is to provide visibility information within a specific business process. The following figure 1 describes how EPCIS data may be generated within a simple business process.</p>
<p><img src="./Fig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Generation of EPCIS events in a simple business process."></p>
<p>Above figure depicts a simplified business process in which a manufacturer produces an item, which is then packed and shipped to the Retailer DC (Distribution Center). The item is received by Retailer DC, who then sends it to the appropriate Retail Store. The item is received by the retail store and moved to a sales area where a consumer can purchase it. The simplified flow of goods can consist of the following critical tracking events: packing, shipping, receiving the items, etc. At every step within these business processes, an EPCIS event is created. This EPCIS event provides information on what exactly was occurring to the items at that particular step. The entirety of all these EPCIS events provides a complete picture of the whole business process.</p>
<p>EPCIS events consist of context information comprising the five different dimensions What, When, Where, Why, and How. Each of these dimensions consists of multiple fields that make up the event information. Each dimension is independent of one another and not mandatory to include all dimensions/fields of dimensions in the EPCIS event. For example, the following pieces of information are produced for four dimensions when a product is shipped from the manufacturer to retail DC in the V2 business process mentioned above:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What</strong>: It contains what items or containers were sent to DC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When</strong>: It contains the date-time information when the items were shipped, along with the respective time zone offset information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Where</strong>: It contains information about the location from where the shipment was sent. Also, where the items are expected to be after the event has occurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why</strong>: It contains the business context of the information. For example, the business step in this particular event is shipping.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="areas-of-application-for-epcis">Areas of application for EPCIS:</h2>
<p>EPCIS can stitch together individual events that have occurred over time in a particular supply chain within an organization or across multiple organizations. Hence, EPCIS provides many applications, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tracking</strong>: An organization can find exactly where the objects are present within the supply chain using the most recent EPCIS event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tracing</strong>: An organization can track the objects to their origin using all EPCIS events associated with the particular object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analysing</strong>: All the EPCIS events collected over a particular time can be interpreted in a specific business context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation</strong>: EPCIS events can trigger various other business processes in real-time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verification</strong>: Comparison of the real-time status of the object using the current EPCIS event and the anticipated state of the object.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="benefits-of-epcis">Benefits of EPCIS:</h2>
<p>EPCIS can be used in various industries such as automotive, healthcare, food services, transport, retail, etc. It provides many benefits to organizations and customers, depending on the type of industry sector. Following are some most common beneficial aspects of the EPCIS standard in various industry sectors:</p>
<p>• Identify the origin of the object to support anti-counterfeit measures.</p>
<p>• Identify a chain of custody for an object along with date and time information.</p>
<p>• Validation of digital coupons in real-time.</p>
<p>• Recognise the freshness of the product.</p>
<p>• Provide notification on various attributes such as location, timing, status, quantity, or quality of the product in real-time.</p>
<p>• Ensure that items reach the consumers at the right location and time.</p>
<p>• Increase consumer protection.</p>
